That figure doesn't even include logistics and labour.

In terms of connectivity, it supported flash storage, SIM card slot, a full USB port, mini USB port and a video out. The overall feel of the device was that it was thick and had a rubberized texture to it. All that has effectively changed in the final version of the device. Apart from the rubberized finish, you'd think the device was redesigned from the ground up. The final unit has lost all the connectivity options its prototype counterpart offered.</td>
